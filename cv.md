# Sergey Chikunov

## Junior Frontend developer
Programming is what I like and what I'm good at. I have eleven years of overall work experience, six of which were dedicated to soft skills in terms of talking to customers and clients, solving their issues. Five years were mainly focused on technical stuff such as implementing the program on the country level, technical support and business analysis.

I believe in the power of education, my goal is knowledge, communication and the possibility to show my worth.
